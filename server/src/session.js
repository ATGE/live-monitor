/**
 * A chat's live session: one `claude` process that stays up between prompts.
 *
 * It used to be one process per prompt, resumed from the transcript on disk.
 * That has two costs that grow with the conversation. Every prompt re-reads
 * the whole transcript before answering — the one for #942 is 12.9 MB, so that
 * chat starts slower with every message. And a one-shot process kills the
 * commands it sent to the background when its turn ends: a build launched
 * with `run_in_background` from a chat did not survive the reply.
 *
 * Driving the SDK with streaming input (`prompt` as an async iterable) keeps
 * the process alive: each pushed message is a turn, each turn ends with its
 * own `result`, and what runs in the background reports back between turns.
 *
 * Measured while building this: the CLI also starts turns *on its own* — when
 * a background command finishes it wakes the model to react — so results
 * cannot be matched to prompts by order. Each prompt carries a uuid and the
 * frames of the turn that answers it echo that uuid back; that is what a
 * result is matched against.
 *
 * The process still goes away when nobody is talking to it — after `idleMs`
 * of quiet — and the next prompt resumes the same transcript. The thread
 * survives; only the process is recycled. Quiet means quiet on both sides:
 * the timer counts from the last frame the process sent, not from the end of
 * our last prompt, and it does not run at all while the process has a turn
 * of its own going or a subagent / background command still out. On #937 it
 * counted from a prompt that a foreign result had closed in zero seconds,
 * and fifteen minutes later it killed two subagents in mid-implementation.
